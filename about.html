		<h1>About</h1>
			
			<div class="sect">
			
			Buggulch.com was launched in December 2023 by John Cunningham as a project to share outdoor adventure content. 
			The creation of the website was inspired by old outdoor blogs and archives of the 90’s and early 2000’s. 
			To replicate the easy to navigate and practical style of these webpages, buggulch.com is made using basic html and
			css code in notepad++ text editor. It operates out of Berkeley, CA, resulting in most of the content focusing on
			the exploration of California. However, the purpose of the website is not to share exact places to travel. It is 
			to inspire people to plan their own creative trips. That said, little traffic is expected to make its way to bug gulch. 
			So while the website hopes to serve outdoor enthusiasts, it more so acts as a place for the author to archive a lifetime 
			of experiences, methodologies, and philosophies.<br><br>
			
			Feel free to email comments and questions to buggulch(at)gmail(dot)com.
