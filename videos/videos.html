			<h2>Redding to Red Bluff</h2>
			Good friends Mason, Sid, and Preston traveled 2500 miles across the country to experience California’s beautiful
			high alpine terrain. The east coasters were welcomed with a surge of cold weather, rain, and smoke. This triplex 
			unexpectedly forced the boys from the mountains to the flatlands of Redding. While not as trendy as their home, 
			Redding offers a wonderful float down California’s largest river. So the ensemble took to the water with 6 of their 
			finest mates and unleashed their inner Jack Sparrow.<br>

			<h2>Banks of the Sacramento</h2>
			To many bay areaians Sacramento is merely a pit stop on the way to Tahoe. But, the city's large rivers and 
			backyards are much more interesting than its in n out burgers and shopping centers. This video documents time 
			well spent in and around the capital city during the first half of 2023. Light the beam!<br>

			<h2>Bay area waterfalls</h2>
			Storm after storm, waterfall after waterfall. 2023's record setting winter did not disappoint.<br><br>

			With travel to the mountains frequently barred by snowstorms, friends and I ventured out to local canyons
			in search of waterfalls. Not only did we find several amazing cascades, but also discovered that waterfall
			hunting is one of the best ways to explore nature. A rainy day hike up a hidden gully can easily beat a blue
			bird power day on the mountain.<br><br>
