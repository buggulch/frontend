				<h2>Fish on</h2>

				<h2>Emigrant Wilderness backpacking 2024</h2>
				You can sure do a lot with 8 nights in the wilderness.<br>
				Get as far away from a road as any place in the country.<br>
				Catch a big trout and cook it on the fire.<br>
				Wake up at night to take a piss and see stars so bright they hurt your eyes.<br>
				The trails fade and so does life back in the city.<br><br>

				Emigrant Wilderness July 4 - 12, 2024<br>

				<h2>Banks of the Sacramento</h2>
				To many bay areaians Sacramento is merely a pit stop on the way to Tahoe. But, the city's large rivers and 
				backyards are much more interesting than its in n out burgers and shopping centers. This video documents time 
				well spent in and around the capital city during the first half of 2023. Light the beam!<br>

				<h2>Winter garden timelapse</h2>
				The slow yet satisfying growth of my 2022-2023 winter garden. It consisted of peas, celery, strawberries, onions and herbs.

				<h2>Bay area waterfalls</h2>
				Storm after storm, waterfall after waterfall. 2023's record setting winter did not disappoint.<br><br>

				With travel to the mountains frequently barred by snowstorms, friends and I ventured out to local canyons
				in search of waterfalls. Not only did we find several amazing cascades, but also discovered that waterfall
				hunting is one of the best ways to explore nature. A rainy day hike up a hidden gully can easily beat a blue
				bird power day on the mountain.<br><br>

				Plan your visit!<br>

				<h2>Redding to Red Bluff</h2>
				
				Good friends Mason, Sid, and Preston traveled 2500 miles across the country to experience California’s beautiful
				high alpine terrain. The east coasters were welcomed with a surge of cold weather, rain, and smoke. This triplex 
				unexpectedly forced the boys from the mountains to the flatlands of Redding. While not as trendy as their home, 
				Redding offers a wonderful float down California’s largest river. So the ensemble took to the water with 6 of their 
				finest mates and unleashed their inner Jack Sparrow.<br>
