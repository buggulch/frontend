<h1>Usal Beach, Sinkyone Wilderness - Car Camping</h1>
		
<div class="sect">

<b>Location: </b>Usal Beach, Sinkyone Wilderness<br>
<b>Type of trip: </b>Car Camping<br>
<b>Date: </b>Aug. 18-20, 2017<br>
<b>People: </b>Ian Good, Sean Yao<br><br>

Sean and I met up with Ian in Davis, where we hopped into his old Durango that was parked on his front lawn. 
We made our way northbound to Usal Beach road, an iconic cliffside road that drops down to a beach campground 
at the southern end of the Lost Coast. <br><br>

The “campground” is a shanty norcal outpost littered with abandoned cars, elk, and other wrinkled creatures of the north coast. 
The shady spooky sites are not the most tasteful, so we opted to hike our gear down the beach and camp in the sand. We set up 
under a cliffy cove, out of sight and sound of the campground. An old man on a quad suggested we would get wiped out from the 
incoming tide, but we held our ground and were dry in the morning. <br><br>

While cooking breakfast a couple Humboldt locals were much more impressed by our site than the old man. 
Beers in hand, they peered up the cliff and admired the potential acoustics the spot would provide for a 
speaker system. They were on a recon trip to find the ideal spot for a beach party banger and were friendly 
enough to give us their email that ended with @bppulse.com. Frankly, we knew whatever party they were 
throwing was out of our league.<br><br>

We headed out after two days living like pirates in the sand and exploring the backroads of the area. <br><br>
