<h1>Death Valley National Park - Car Camping</h1>
		
<div class="sect">

<b>Location: </b>Death Valley National Park<br>
<b>Type of trip: </b>Car Camping<br>
<b>Date: </b>Dec. 31, 2020 - Jan. 4, 2021<br>
<b>People: </b>Matt Lane, Michael McGill, Sean Yao<br><br>

This was the San Carlos crew’s 4th annual new years camping trip. Everyone was beyond down for a solid 4 nighter because 
the previous year’s trip to Sinkyone Wilderness was so good. The Death Valley idea arose because of the projected rain 
throughout the rest of California.<br><br>

We left San Carlos on new year’s eve morning and managed to get to the Trona Pinnacles with enough time to hike around, play catch, 
and toss some die. Winds picked up at sun down but eased up by dark. We had a nice fire and played John Pardi’s Heartache Mediation 
album fully through.<br><br>

The next day we cruised into the national park and hiked Fall Canyon. A quarter mile before the end of the main canyon, we stopped to 
check our guidebook for directions. The book, <i>Hiking Death Valley</i> by Michael Digonnet, noted that at the end of the main canyon there is a 
“slick 18-foot fall” with a bypass that allows you to get to the canyon’s best narrows. As we reviewed the book, two old guys walked 
by and one stated, “I see you have the bible”. They went on to praise the book and tell us how they did not make it past the fall but 
that we most definitely will. The bypass ended up being more difficult than expected but we did make it. The narrows were exceptional 
and once we reached the end of the tightest section of narrows, we spotted a bighorn sheep on the walls above us. We finished the hike at golden 
hour and didn’t find a camp spot until dark. Death Valley dispersed campsites can be very hard to come by.<br><br>
 
The next couple days we explored Ubehebe Crater, Furnace Creek, Badwater Basin, and Sidewinder Canyon. The Sidewinder Canyon narrows 
were the highlight of the trip. We left the park through the town of Shoshone and drove 8 hours home on our last day.<br><br>
