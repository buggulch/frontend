<h1>Sonora Pass to Leavitt Meadows, Emigrant Wilderness - Backpacking</h1>
		
<div class="sect">

<b>Location: </b>Sonora Pass to Leavitt Meadows, Emigrant Wilderness<br>
<b>Type of trip: </b>Backpacking<br>
<b>Date: </b>Aug. 30 - Sep. 3, 2020<br>
<b>People: </b>Preston Quilici, David Krawitz, Doug Ward, Michael Young<br><br>

This was an infamous backpacking trip filled with drama. It began on a smoky Sunday in late Summer 2020. The crew met up at Doug’s family cabin in Pinecrest where Doug’s mom hooked 
us up with some really good breakfast burritos. We took two cars from the cabin to Leavitt Meadows, parked one and drove the other back up to Sonora Pass. The plan was to spend 5 days 
hiking a route from Sonora Pass to Leavitt meadows.
<br><br>
We left Sonora Pass around 2 pm and hiked south along one of the PCT’s finest stretches of trail. After a few miles we veered off the trail and set up camp at Latopie Lake. It was a 
nice place to stay and acclimate to the high altitude.
<br><br>
The next morning we packed up and continued south on the PCT. Soon after starting the hike, Doug mentioned his ankle was hurting. I didn’t take anything of it and remarked “we got a 
long way to go Dougie”. However, at our next break Doug was more adamant that his ankle really f**kin hurt. I told Doug we were coming up on the Leavitt Lake trail turn off, the only 
way out for the next 25 miles. The next mile of hiking was silent. At the turnoff, Doug sat on the ground and tended to his ankle, while the rest of the group stood over him in shock. 
Doug sadly admitted it was his time to go. Before another word was spoken, Dave declared that he must leave with Doug. No one objected, though it was only a 4 mile hike to Highway 108. 
<br><br>
So just like that our crew of five had dwindled to three. Preston, Mikey, and I remained. We hypothesized that Dave masterminded the staging of Doug’s injury as a way out of the trip. 
It was all too real picturing Dave saying, “Doug Ward what If I told you there were pizzas and beer waiting for us at the cabin… John B is just a bit too ambitious”. Our minds were overtaken 
by this comical theory, allowing us to effortlessly summit Big Sam and finish our 12.5 mile hike to Emigrant Meadow Lake. Views were stunning and spirits were high, except for the fact we caught 
no fish that evening.
<br><br>
The next day we trekked over to the south side of the lake and noticed the water was quite a bit deeper than where we had camped. On a whim, we decided to toss a line in. We immediately 
started landing some fat trout and cooked them up for lunch. It felt great knowing that there was only more fishing to come at Snow Lake a few miles away.
<br><br>
But our high did not last long. Minutes after leaving the lake, Preston asked me when we planned to exit the wilderness. I was skeptical he didn’t know the answer but still he egg’d me 
for a response. I told him Thursday and just like that he objected that he thought we were getting out on Wednesday. Subsequently, a long raged argument arose and ended with Preston 
proclaiming he would hike out on his own. It seemed all this talk of pizza and beer had caught up with him. We should’ve sent him home with the other’s.
<br><br>
Sadly, Mikey and I realized we needed to submit to the wrath of Preston’s request to leave early. This meant we needed to hike 20 miles in two days instead of three and would plan on staying 
at Dorothy Lake for our last night. The trail disappeared quickly, symbolic of the disappearance of Dave, Doug, and our plans for a Thursday exit. Our high route peered directly down on the 
most beautiful alpine meadows I had ever seen with Snow Lake perched above it. 
<br><br>
The night at Dorothy was ominous. Large clouds of smoke rolled in as we casted our lines. I caught one trout. Its eyes were dark black, seemingly possessed by the smoke. Our water filter 
had clogged and a haggard southbound PCT hiker arrived late in the evening with recounts of the wildfires up north. Mikey went to sleep with an N95 mask on. This self-inflicted debacle had 
led us into a hell-like dimension.
<br><br>
After 14 miles of hiking to Leavitt Meadows the next day, we called Doug hoping to be chauffeured back to Sonora Pass. He kindly ditched his dinner plans with his parents and picked us up. 
The last night was spent harmoniously grilling burgers at Doug’s cabin and sharing stories of the dramatic yet amazing trip. We headed back to the Bay the next morning, about 8 hours earlier 
than we would’ve if we kept our original plans.
